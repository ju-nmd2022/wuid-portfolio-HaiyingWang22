                    <div class="city">
                        I have been living in Jönköping since last year. Although it is not a large city,<br>
                        it has many beautiful landscapes. For example in Gränna which is a town in Jönköping.<br> 
                        You get a beautiful view of the lake and there's an island in the middle of it which <br>
                        I often go hiking on. Also, during the year, I tasted a lot of local Swedish food <br>
                        e.g. cinnamon buns, and herring.
