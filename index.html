            <h3>Life in Jönköping</h3>
            <div class="city">
                I have been living in Jönköping since last year. Although it is not a large city,<br>
                it has many beautiful landscapes. For example in Gränna which is a town in Jönköping.<br> 
                You get a beautiful view of the lake and there's an island in the middle of it which <br>
                I often go hiking on. Also, during the year, I tasted a lot of local Swedish food <br>
                e.g. cinnamon buns, and herring.
